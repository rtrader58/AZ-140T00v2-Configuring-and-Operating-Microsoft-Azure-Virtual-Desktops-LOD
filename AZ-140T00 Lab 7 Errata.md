# AZ-140T00 Configuring and Operating Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop Lab 7 Errata

## Lab 7 - Create and manage session host images ~90 Minutes

### Exercise 1: Create custom session host images by using image templates
All steps work as written, you do not have to change anything <br>

Task 6: Build a custom image <br>
Step 5: You may have to click see all images > search for DC2s_v3 (note remove standard when searching)
Step 2: Build took over 45 minutes to finish - this is a good point to take a break - but be mindfull of the timer <br>
